# Customer-Segmentation---R-Project
K-means and Hierarchical clustering on a bank's customer data
## Problem Definition    
                
 ### Shaping the inquiries that will guide analysis:                                          
                                                                       
- Predicting loan defaults based on customer behavior.               
- The relationship between customer behavior patterns and their financial needs is not fully understood, creating challenges in crafting targeted marketing campaigns.
    
We shall, therefore, perform a K-means and Hierarchical clustering on a bank's customer data to draw insights on the characteristics of different customers
               
## Metrics for Success                                
                                                                    
This study shall be deemed successful if:                                         
                        
- EDA is properly performed on the data    
- Relevant insights are drawn from data analysis        
- Optimal clustering of customers based on their characteristics
- Comparisons of both K-Means and Hierarchical clustering on the dataset are well illustrated
  
## Context

Customer Segmentation is the process of dividing the customer-base into several groups of individuals that share a similarity in different ways that are relevant to marketing such as gender, age, level of education, credit score, interests, and miscellaneous spending habits etc. Customer segmentation can help us divide a diverse market into a number of smaller, more homogeneous markets based on one or more meaningful characteristics.

## The importance of customer segmentation includes:

- Greater company focus - companies are able to understand its customer base/segments and as such be ware of what products or services to serve what segment of their customer base.
- Targetted communication - with specified segments, companies can know and choose proper communication platforms and pass information relevant to each segment
- Satisfaction of customer preferences - given that segments have some differences among them, say income levels and age, companies can offer different product/service bundles and incentives to different segments.
## The study will be relevant in that, it will:

- Help the bank relate the various customer characteristics, say level of income and age vs chances of default, and so understand where higher credit risks lie.
- Help the bank to employ targetted communication to customer segments
## Experimental Design

Steps followed are:

- Business Understanding
- Reading and previewing data
- Data preprocessing
- Modelling
- Challenging the solution
- Conclusion
## Relevance of the data

Dataset used in this study was sourced from Kaggle and compromises of bank customer information. This information includes: customer age, level of education, years of experience, income, debts and income-debt ratios. The data has 850 observations and 10 features.
